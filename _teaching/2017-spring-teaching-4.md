As a Teaching Assistant for Professor Momin Ayub Uppal ([Website](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/2771)), I had various responsibilities during the ‘CS 535: Machine Learning’ course in Spring 2024. My duties included holding weekly office hours, reviewing, invigilating, and grading quizzes, as well as creating, reviewing, solving assignments and uploading their tutorials. I also engaged in semi-formal student counseling. You can find a sample assignment and its solution I made on Naive Bayes and Estimation Methods [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ugQZqbf_XW8eJjFd3UmraRaIUvZUHZNk?usp=sharing)
