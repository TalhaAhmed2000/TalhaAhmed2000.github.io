As a Teaching Assistant for Professor Usman Elahi during the 'Capacity Building and Training on Data Management & Analysis Using STATA,' I had the privilege of contributing to a comprehensive training program. We conducted nearly 6-hour sessions five days a week, where we immersed participants in STATA content. Each session began with STATA concepts and tools, followed by practical exercises to reinforce learning. We concluded each day with lively discussions of exercise solutions.

This workshop was organized in collaboration with the Bureau of Statistics, Government of Punjab, for Statistical Officers.
