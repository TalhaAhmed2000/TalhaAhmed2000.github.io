As a Teaching Assistant for Professor Momin Ayub Uppal ([Website](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/2771)) in the 'ACTA 6304: Advanced Machine Learning' course for the Master's in Accounting and Analytics program in Fall 2024, I was primarily responsible for designing assignments and labs tailored to meet the needs of business-oriented students. While the course is titled 'Advanced Machine Learning,' the content largely overlaps with the Machine Learning course I TA'ed in Spring 2024, primarily due to the students' limited programming and mathematical backgrounds. My duties included conducting weekly office hours, supervising lab sessions, and creating, reviewing, and solving assignments. Additionally, I provided semi-formal student counseling to support academic success. A collection of assignments and labs, along with their solutions, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iCXz2kx5Hp5O-m5s9w3PWTWS79jpGCc6?usp=sharing).
