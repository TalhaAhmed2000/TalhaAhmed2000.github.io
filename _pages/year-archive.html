      Analyzing Music Trends in the Last Century
    </div>
    <h3 class="conference-name">November 2022 &nbsp;·&nbsp; CS 334: Principles and Techniques of Data Science</h3>
    <p>
      A data science deep-dive into the Spotify dataset, exploring how music has evolved over the last century. The post
      walks through three stages of analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Inference, and Predictive
      Modeling — to answer research questions about shifting trends in tempo, energy, danceability, and genre
      popularity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EDA</strong>: Uncovered temporal patterns in audio features, genre dominance over decades</li>
      <li><strong>Statistical Inference</strong>: Tested hypotheses on structural changes in music characteristics
        pre/post-streaming era</li>
      <li><strong>Predictive Modeling</strong>: Built models to predict song popularity from audio features</li>
    </ul>
