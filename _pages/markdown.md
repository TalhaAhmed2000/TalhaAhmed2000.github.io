In the ever-evolving field of data science, continuous learning is not just an option but a necessity. The rapid pace at which this field is growing demands a commitment to self-improvement and the acquisition of new knowledge and skills. My journey into data science, a significant shift from my original focus in econometrics and mathematics, was accompanied by an even greater need for self-learning.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my esteemed professors, Dr. Ihsan Ayub Qazi, Dr. Muhammad Tahir, and Dr. Hassan Mohy-ud-Din. Their unwavering support and guidance not only kept me motivated but also taught me the value of appreciating the learning process, rather than solely fixating on the end results.

This section is dedicated to recounting my never-ending learning journey. I am committed to facing challenges head-on, exploring peer-reviewed journals, implementing newfound knowledge wherever possible, and, most importantly, embracing a spirit of perpetual learning.
