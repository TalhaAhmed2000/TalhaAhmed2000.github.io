I'm a recent graduate from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), where I completed a joint major in **BS Economics** and **Mathematics**, with a minor in **Computer Science**. 🎓

Currently, I am working as a **Research Assistant** under the supervision of [Dr. Hassan Mohy-Ud-Din](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~hmd/) and informally collaborating with [Dr. Muhammad Tahir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-tahir-aa421590/?originalSubdomain=pk). My current research focuses on the **theory and practice of diffusion models**, particularly in medical imaging and inverse problems, as well as **interpretable and controllable diffusion models** with applications in signal processing and/or natural language preprocssing.

In addition to this, I have a keen interest and experience in **interpretable deep learning**, specifically **unrolled optimization frameworks** within the realm of **compressed sensing**. Although my experience is limited, I am also open to exploring **(Multi-Agent) Reinforcement Learning** 🕹️.

Feel free to explore my academic journey and projects on this website. Thanks for visiting! 😊
