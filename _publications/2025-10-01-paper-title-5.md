Working alongside Dr. Muhammad Tahir ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-tahir-aa421590/?originalSubdomain=pk)), this project aims to advance the interpretability and control mechanisms of diffusion models, specifically tailored for applications in signal processing and semantic correspondence. Notably, this research overlaps with the work being conducted with Dr. Hassan, *Theory and Practice of Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging and Inverse Problems*, and hence information on both projects can be found in the ongoing survey accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D-vG6jOiDuBTMg74H26bAwi5SuM7A1tS?usp=sharing).

Some of the specific research questions we have been exploring include:

- How can diffusion models be adapted for signal processing applications where input signals exhibit complex distributions, such as salt-and-pepper noise, rather than conventional Gaussian noise?
- How can we ensure that the generated images are semantically meaningful and consistent with the input image such as those produced by StableDiffusion? And how can we extract that for further extrapolation in an unsupervised manner?
