This research project, in collaboration with Dr. Hassan Mohy-ud-Din ([Website](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~hmd/)) and informally with Dr. Muhammad Tahir, investigates both the theoretical and practical dimensions of diffusion models, with a particular emphasis on medical imaging, inverse problems, and signal processing.

- **Extensive Survey**: We are undertaking a comprehensive survey that compiles recent advancements in diffusion models specifically designed for inverse problems. This includes notable algorithms such as [BIRD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572), [DPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14687), [Blind-DPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10656), and [ReSample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08123), each uniquely addressing the challenges posed by inverse problems through diffusion methodologies.

- **Addressing Medical Imaging Challenges**: The survey highlights critical challenges in medical imaging, such as data reconstruction from (non)linear degradations, including issues of low resolution, deblurring, phase retrieval, artifact removal, and high-dimensionality. We will discuss how diffusion models can effectively address these issues, leveraging techniques like unsupervised (conditional) fine-tuning, plug-and-play methods that utilize pretrained restoration modules or generative priors, cross-modality learning, and latent space optimizations (e.g., [ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543), [StableSR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015), [MedSyn](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566053), [SDSeg](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72111-3_62), [CoDi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01407), [DiffBR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15070), [ADD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17042)).

- **Conditional Medical Image Segmentation**: A primary objective of this research is to advance "conditional medical image segmentation," where conditions may range from text prompts to volume slices. This initiative aims to enable more complex multi-class segmentations, particularly in applications like Cardiac MRI, with the potential to alleviate the computational demands associated with high-dimensional 2D and 3D segmentation tasks.

- **Ongoing Work**: This project is actively progressing, and a work-in-progress survey is accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1roK1ScRDl3pC-Bq70CJ_pRBRIHqOXYjH?usp=sharing).
