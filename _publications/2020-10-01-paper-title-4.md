This research project with Dr. Hassan Mohy-ud-Din ([Website](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~hmd/)) involves an in-depth study and application of diffusion models within medical imaging and inverse problems.

- Currently focused on compiling a comprehensive survey of diffusion models, detailing key algorithms, methodologies, and their efficacy in medical imaging and other inverse problems.
- Tasks include evaluating models, deriving proofs of key algorithms, and creating code implementations.
- Working towards demonstrating the impact of diffusion models in medical imaging by addressing challenges in data reconstruction, noise removal, and interpretability.
- Project is ongoing, with work-in-progress survey accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D-vG6jOiDuBTMg74H26bAwi5SuM7A1tS?usp=sharing).
