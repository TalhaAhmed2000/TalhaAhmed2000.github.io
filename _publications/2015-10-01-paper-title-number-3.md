The project with Dr. Hassan Mohy-ud-Din ([Website](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~hmd/)) involved the following

- Doing readings on various prominent mathematical inequalities in the field of data science and information theory.
- Compiling reading materials from YouTube videos, journals, conference papers, etc.
- Each inequality is accompanied by essential background information, a proof, intriguing considerations, practical applications, and a demonstration in Python/MATLAB.
- Example: [Jensen's Inequality](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uvd6wwxslyiasaspdmngl/Jensen_s_Inequality.pdf?rlkey=csoiwfh59iyagmxy9cw66bm1v&dl=0)
