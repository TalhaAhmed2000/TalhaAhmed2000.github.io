- Self-taught fundamental methods and techniques in *Advanced Signal Processing*
- Implemented some popular Deep Learning Algorithms ([Github Link](https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/DeepLearning))
- Currently doing a reading course on High Dimensional Data Analysis and Compressed Sensing. Primary text being followed is [Book Link](https://book-wright-ma.github.io/Book-WM-20210422.pdf) by John Wright and Yi Ma.
- Self-taught preliminaries like *Duality Theory* and optimization techniques like *Augmented Lagrange Multiplier - ALM* to understand the problem formulation and solve Matrix Completion.
- Replicated results of the following papers [Link 1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906418) and [Link 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906418)
- Completed and refined a proposed algorithm *ConvMC-Net* for standard matrix completion problems. [Github Link](https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/convmc-net)
- To handle robust matrix completion, currently drawing inspiration from Deep Learning techniques and applying it to the proposed *M-estimation* algorithm in paper [Link 3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682657)
