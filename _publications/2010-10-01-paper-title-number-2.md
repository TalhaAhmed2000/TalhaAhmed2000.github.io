We started this project with Dr.Muhammad Tahir ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-tahir-aa421590/?originalSubdomain=pk)) in Summer 2023 and it concluded in May 2024. A brief compilation of what we did is shown below.

- Self-taught fundamental methods and techniques in *Advanced Signal Processing*
- Implemented some popular Deep Learning Algorithms ([Github Link](https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/DeepLearning))
- Did a reading course on High Dimensional Data Analysis and Compressed Sensing. Primary text followed was [Book Link](https://book-wright-ma.github.io/Book-WM-20210422.pdf) by John Wright and Yi Ma.
- Self-taught preliminaries like *Duality Theory* and optimization techniques like *Augmented Lagrange Multiplier - ALM* to understand the problem formulation and solve Matrix Completion.
- Replicated results of following papers [Paper 1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906418), [Paper 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9906418) and prominent MC algorithms - ([Github Link](https://github.com/Talha-Nehal-Undegrad-Study/M-estimation-RMC/tree/main))
- Completed and refined a proposed *unfolded* ALM algorithm *ConvMC-Net* for standard matrix completion problem. [Github Link](https://github.com/TalhaAhmed2000/convmc-net)
- Proposed *unfolded* *M-estimation* ([Paper 3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682657)) based algorithm *ConvHuberMC-Net* for robust matrix completion in the event of impulsive Gaussian noise. [Github Link](https://github.com/Talha-Nehal-Undegrad-Study/ConvHuberMC-Net)
