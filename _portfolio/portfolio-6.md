As part of a research project for ECON 438: Econometrics II, we used a german healthcare dataset which is of panel data nature, and explored the research question *What are the factors that determine the number
of recent doctor or hospital visits of an individual*?

We addressed the research question using two methods:
1. Zooming in on a single cross-section and using *tobit* models.
2. Using panel data models involving *fixed, random* effects and their numerous variants.

Much attention was paid to whether key assumptions like *normality* for tobit models or presence of *serial auto-correlation* for panel data models were violated or not. ([Project Report + Source Code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bs1F2-XmUO2qL9M3gwKL2TXHLgkOmlAE?usp=sharing)).
